## Problem Statement

We want to build a dog breed classifier application that will will enable us to predict a dog's breed based on the image. This solution will use the latest Google Cloud AutoML solution for training the model.

For this project,  We developed the analysis pipeline in 4 steps

* Gathered and prepped  the data (https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip)
* Used the transformed data to train the model using Google AutoML mode.
* tested it and evaluated the performance.
* deployed to the model using a Flask Web App
